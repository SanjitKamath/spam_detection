# Email Classification System

## Overview
This project is an email classification system designed to detect spam using a RandomForestClassifier. It involves generating synthetic email data, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creates realistic email data with attributes like text content, headers, and sender reputation.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Standardizes data for improved model performance.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier for effective spam detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- **Visualization:** Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize key insights from the model's predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Run the data generation script to create the dataset or use the existing dataset.
2. Execute the model training script to build and evaluate the classifier.
3. Use the visualization tools to interpret results effectively.

## Results
The RandomForestClassifier achieves high accuracy, with performance visualizations offering clear insights into model predictions.
